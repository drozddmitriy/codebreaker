  $ Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code\n
  created by a code-maker. The codemaker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re\n
  going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.\n\n

  $ The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen\n
  difficulty). In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. The codemaker\n
  then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces.\n\n

  $ A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the\n
  numbers in the secret code and in the same position. For example:\n
  Secret number - 1234\n
  Input number - 6264\n
  Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n\n

  $ A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the\n
  numbers in the secret code but in a different position. For example:\n
  Secret number - 1234\n
  Input number - 6462\n
  Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n\n

  $ An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.\n\n

  $ If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the\n
  game. If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.\n\n

  $ Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes\n
  a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.\n"
